# Capture-Fire Redux

* **Originality:** The game introduces the ability to turn enemy attacks into ammo that the player can use to fire back.
* **Technical Merit:** While standard in terms of shmups, the game does incorporate many features that appear in classics of the genre.
* **Prototype Postmortem:** Besides adding new features, this was an exercise in optimization.
* **Prototype Assets:** All assets were made by me.
* **Prototype Closest Other Game:** The biggest inspiration for this game was U.N. Squadron, a shmup for the SNES and a personal favorite.
* **High Concept:** Fly a helicopter with the ability to turn attacks back on the enemy.
* **Theme:** The enemies and background are meant to invoke a "space" theme, but the player is a helicopter.
* **Mandated Variety:** The player can use the arrow keys, spacebar, and ZX, or the mouse, and can switch between the two by pressing the LMB or the spacebar. Enemies are generated at random, fire at random, and zigzag randomly across the screen. This game is a shmup where the player is meant to weave between bullets to be able to counterattack.
* **Prototype Goal:** The new mechanic introduced is the ability to project a "wave" in front of the helicopter that can block enemy bullets and turn them into ammo for an alternate weapon.
* **Player Experience Goals:** The game is meant to have a fast-paced and somewhat frantic experience.
* **Gameplay:** There are two input sets: mouse and keyboard. They are equivalent in features, with both including input for movement, firing, swapping weapons, and using the wave. The player starts with no weapons, and can only defend themself with the "wave", a short-range shield. When the wave hits a bullet, it is destroyed and the player gains an alternate fire. Up to two alternate fires can be switched between using the change fire button. Weapons have a limited amount of ammunition, and once they are depleted, the player will switch back to having no weapon. The player has a natural armor that can be removed by enemy fire. If the player is hit by a bullet, they will enter a vunerable state, where any other attack will cause instant termination. This also applies to collisions with enemies, but in that case the enemy persists, meaning that it is possible to die instantly from a single collision. Each enemy destroyed yields points, depending on the type, and slightly speeds up the enemy spawn rate. Some enemies and weapons also have special effects. For example, the "Titan" shoots missiles that stun.
* **Strategies:** Apart from weaving, players should be able to use the wave as a shield to clear bullets away, although it does have a cooldown.
* **Story/Setting/Premise:** The game has a very minimal story. The player uses a space-helicopter to launch an ultimately futile attack against aliens.
* **Target Audience:** The game would obviously appeal to shmup fans, but is meant to also be of some interest to any gamer.
* **Play Time:** A single game can take a few minutes.
