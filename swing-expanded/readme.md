# Swing - Expanded Edition

* **Originality:** Probably a lot of the gameplay has been done before, since the game is, at its core, a simple reflex/timing game. The originality comes from the presentation.
* **Technical Merit:** Despite the 2D perspective, the baseball moves in three dimensions, making the game feel more interactive.
* **Prototype Postmortem:** Surprisingly, the coding was easy. This was mostly an exercise in graphic design.
* **Prototype Assets:** All assets were made by me.
* **Prototype Closest Other Game:** This game was mostly inspired by an old flash game called "Tan go tokkun-chÅ«! 2", but usually just referred to as "Japanese Baseball". A lot of the mechanics are inspired by the game, including the difficulty levels, but in that game the main challenge was aim, which I decided to remove completely (it was sort of in there at one point).
* **High Concept:** Whack a baseball as far as you can to get points.
* **Theme:** Besides the ball and chain, the game follows a baseball theme.
* **Mandated Variety:** The game proper only uses one button: the spacebar. Players must time their swings to hit the ball as squarely as possible. The lower levels are not randomized at all, but the third level uses a variety of pitches to trick the player.
* **Prototype Goal:** The game was meant to turn a mundane timing concept into something interesting.
* **Player Experience Goals:** The physics are designed to feel dynamic, like the swings actually have force. Adding to that, critical hits are meant to feel more powerful. The high scores are meant to add some excitement over achievement.
* **Gameplay:** Form the menu, the player can press the 1, 2, or 3 keys to start the game with the specified difficulty level. Once in the game, the player gets a stock of 10 baseballs. The game periodically fires them down the screen, and the player can press the spacebar to swing a mace. If the mace connects with a baseball, the baseball is launched, with the distance and direction depending on the accuracy of the swing. The player is then awarded with points based on the distance. If a swing connects perfectly with the ball, it launches it much farther, awarding bonus points. At any point, the player can press "s" to swap between a small, fast mace and a large, slow mace. The slow mace requires better timing but allows for more accurate swings. Once the player's stock is depleted, the game ends. At the highest level, the speed of the baseballs is unpredictable, but the points are increased. At the end of the game, the player is shown the high score screen, and if their score was high enough to appear there, they can enter their initials.
* **Strategies:** The player should take note of where in the mace's swing launches the baseball the farthest. The larger mace is preferable when trying to get criticals.
* **Story/Setting/Premise:** There is nothing in the way of story.
* **Target Audience:** The game should appeal to fans of short, arcade-style games.
* **Play Time:** A single game can take less than a minute. The game is meant to be played multiple times in a row.
