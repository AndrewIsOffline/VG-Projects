# Swing

* **Originality:** Probably a lot of the gameplay has been done before, since the game is, at its core, a simple reflex/timing game. The originality comes from the presentation.
* **Technical Merit:** Despite the 2D perspective, the baseball moves in three dimensions, making the game feel more interactive.
* **Prototype Postmortem:** Surprisingly, the coding was easy. This was mostly an exercise in graphic design.
* **Prototype Assets:** All assets were made by me.
* **Prototype Closest Other Game:** This game was mostly inspired by an old flash game called "Tan go tokkun-chÅ«! 2", but usually just referred to as "Japanese Baseball". A lot of the mechanics are inspired by the game, including the difficulty levels, but in that game the main challenge was aim, which I decided to remove completely (it was sort of in there at one point).
* **High Concept:** Whack a baseball as far as you can to get points.
* **Theme:** Besides the ball and chain, the game follows a baseball theme.
* **Mandated Variety:** The game proper only uses one button: the spacebar. Players must time their swings to hit the ball as squarely as possible. The lower levels are not randomized at all, but the third level uses a variety of pitches to trick the player.
* **Prototype Goal:** The game was meant to turn a mundane timing concept into something interesting.
* **Player Experience Goals:** The physics are designed to feel dynamic, like the swings actually have force.
