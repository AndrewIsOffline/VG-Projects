# The Human Experience

* **Originality:** While the "gameplay" is very simple, the game is original in its abstract situations.
* **Technical Merit:** The game makes use of an image that players can create in the game.
* **Prototype Postmortem:** While making the drawing functionality, I got insight into microStudio's internals. I also gained some experience in making pixel art, and was able to make a decent drawing of a milk jug, something that I previously thought was outside my current ability.
* **Prototype Assets:** All assets were made by me.
* **Prototype Closest Other Game:** The game was directly inspired by "Four Second Frenzy" and "Four Second Fury", two flash games in a similar playstyle to the WarioWare series. In the games, the player would have four seconds to complete some action using the arrow keys and spacebar. The games were made colaboratively by a group of animators, and frequently feature absurd situations.
* **High Concept:** Perform various tasks to gain TRUE humanity.
* **Theme:** The various activities are presented as having a deeper meaning of self-reflection, but are meant to be humerous.
* **Mandated Variety:** The player can use the arrow keys and space bar. During the introduction, the player can use the mouse to draw their character and the full keyboard to enter a name (which is immediately discarded). The game can be classified as an action game.
* **Prototype Goal:** The game is meant to explore ways of engaging the player through narrative instead of gameplay.
* **Player Experience Goals:** The game is meant to be funny, both through the use of absurd situations and cultural references.
* **Gameplay:** Most menus can be navigated through by pressing the space bar. On starting the game, the game gives an interface where the player can use the mouse to draw the face of their character. Upon finishing and pressing the space bar, the game places a clown nose over the face. The next screen lets the player enter their name. When the player completes this, the game discards the name and replaces it with a random name that is meant to be mildly insulting and humerous. The game then explains the premise, and proceeds with five games, with a text screen appearing between each game.
The first task has the player press the space bar repeatedly to swing a baseball bat and fill up a meter. Once the meter is full, a larger bat slams down on them, ending the task.
The second task is a simple pizza building game. The player can move left and right by pressing the arrow keys, and if they have an item it can be dropped with the space bar. The player has no friction, and items keep their momentum when dropped. The player must move over the box of stuff to get items and then drop them onto the pizza. The ingredients are tomato, cheese, and them pineapple, recreating the infamous "pineapple on pizza" discussion.
The third task is a jumping game similar to the microStudio tutorial, but with a ceiling and two rows of evenly spaced spikes. The player must use the up button to time their jumps to bounce in between the spikes, and avoid consecutive spikes to get a better score. Once they reach a high enough score, the next jump activates a wrecking ball, which swings into the player and ends the task.
The fourth task is similar to the second one, except now the player must hold down the space bar to throw the items in an arc. Holding the space bar down more changes the angle, but the speed of the change is very fast. This time the player is making the infamous milk steak, with the third throw adding ketchup to the mix.
The final task tells the player to "find themself". In this challenge, the player can control the size of the face that they made at the start of the game using the arrow keys, and they must line it up with the circle head to recreate the image. The resizing controls the rate of change and the controls are rotated, making the task somewhat challenging.
At the end of the game the player is congratulated for completing their tasks and achieving their humanity before stating that their humanity is terrible and apologizing.
* **Strategies:** The game has a trivial level of difficulty.
* **Story/Setting/Premise:** The game is persented as a series of tasks that the player must comlpete in order to gain "humanity".
* **Target Audience:** Rather than targeting an audience based on genre, the game is simple enough for anyone to play, and its entertainment value comes from its presentation.
* **Play Time:** A single game can take a few minutes.
